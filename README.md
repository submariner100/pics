Using HTTP on a flutter application - The application returns images from a server and displays them on the UI.

During this lesson I covered many things to do with the Flutter IDE which included using different ways to import files into a flutter project.

I learnt all about the Dart Http package and how to set it up.

StatelessWidgets and StatefulWidgets were covered. 

A image model was set up.
